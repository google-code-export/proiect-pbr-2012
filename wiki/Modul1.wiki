=== General Objectives:===
 * Propose a simple language communication between the system and user (see use case 1, 2, 3); 
 * Suggest a way to generate system utterances (see section 2);
 *  Build a website in which users who love dogs are inclined to interact with your system through user dialogs as described in case 1, 2 and 3.The application has to animate the avatar MY-DOG based on sequences of predicates of actions and will be sent as a result of system-user dialogue;
 * Create 200 interactions S‐U User type case 1 from which  to deduct a set of significant features for at least 6 dog breeds; 

=== The behavior of the system (use Cases) ===

  * *Use case 1*
The user, dog owner, identfies selff to the system, also stating the dog breed. The system generates a random event and the user is asked to indicate the dog behavior( MY-DOG )in that specific situation.(see the example in pages 3-4 from the project presentation: http://profs.info.uaic.ro/~dcristea/cursuri/SE/2012/2011-2012/Proiect/Proiect%20PBR-martie%202012.pdf)


  * *Use case 2*
The system generates a random situation and behavior, and the user, willing to engage in knowledge of the breed, dog breed is made ​​to guess.

  * *Use case 3*
The user enters a number of features of behavior which he/she would like to have his dog and the system will deduce the breed (maybe a lot of individual copies that you have registered in the database).

=== Organizational Details ===

I ask the 2 work groups that the archieve and the files in text format to be uploaded in the *"Downloads"* section.
(http://code.google.com/p/proiect-pbr-2012/downloads/list) Each post has to have at the begining of each file the Modul 1 initiales(*M1*) – so that we can make a simple distinguish between other modules. The source cods of Modul 1 will be uploaded in "modul1" file of the Source section.(http://code.google.com/p/proiect-pbr-2012/source/browse/trunk/).
